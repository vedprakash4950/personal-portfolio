This web application is running on Node.js version 18.20.4.

This is a stable LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js that's well-suited for production applications. The project uses:

Node.js: 18.20.4
Vite: 5.4.2 (as the build tool and dev server)
React: 18.3.1
TypeScript: 5.5.3
Node.js 18 is an excellent choice for modern web development as it includes:

Native ES modules support
Improved performance
Built-in test runner
Fetch API support
Enhanced security features
The application is built as a static site using Vite, so it doesn't require a Node.js server to run in production - it's deployed as static files on Netlify.
